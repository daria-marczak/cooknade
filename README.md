# Recipe app

Application for storing, finding and creating new recipes. Created in order to learn how to configure PWA apps and Vue.

## Start the application

In order to start the app, you should clone this repository, install all the dependencies, then run `npm start` to launch Webpack dev server with HMR.

## Technologies used

As a part of my learning, I used several technologies that are new for me.

-   Vue
-   Vuex
-   Vue Router (WIP)
-   Flickity
-   Webpack configured manually
-   Vuetify
